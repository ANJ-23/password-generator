# Password Generator

## Description

This is a password generator made to demonstrate user interactivity in a website via JavaScript. The site allows visiters to press a button, then respond to different browser prompts that determine a randomly generated password. The password can then be used on other sites.

The utilized JavaScript includes functions, loops/iterations, built-in methods for strings and random number generation, an object, messages sent through the browser, and ternary statements.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Open the website (https://anj-23.github.io/password-generator/), and press the "Generate Password" button and follow the browser's prompts. Enter the number of characters desired (between 8-128), then choose whether special characters, upper case letters, lower case letters, and numbers are included.
